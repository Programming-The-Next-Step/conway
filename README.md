Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. A cellular automaton is a grid / lattice of cells. Each cell is neighbors with the adjacent cells in the horizontal, vertical and diagonal (i.e., north, south, east, west, and diagonal) directions. The cells update their states as a function of the states of the neighboring cells. Whether they 

Each cell is either on or off at a given time, and updates its state as a function of the states of its neighboring cells.
